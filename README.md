This Project is for demonstrate how to set up a security service like keycloak in a full stack application: 
- Important to know that this is not a final project not ready for production it still need some desgning + a real db + some best practices.
- When running the project u must set up keycloak because i used a dev version just in my machine to see the result.
- In the repo you will see 3 main resurses 
1. Connecting my keycloak server to my app
2. An app with thymleaf as a frontend
3. An app for angular as a frantend
